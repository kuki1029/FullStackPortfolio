                The inspiration behind this project was to get more familiar with TypeScript and also pickup some
                GraphQl. Both of which I have succesfully done. I also wanted to learn more of the DevOps side of things
                by learning how to contanerize my apps, host them through AWS, and also setup a rever proxy with Nginx.
                I want to use this space to talk about the structure of the app and also some of the challenges I faced
                while building it.
                <!-- make image clicakble -->
                <!-- Talk about backend section. the struggles for each. like setting up database schema. struggles with TS. websocket config. not using TS properly  -->
                <!-- frontend using react and mantine. setting up cache with apollo client -->
                <!-- things i might do different next time. like diff component library. diff framework. check azure.  -->
                <!-- talk abt app being in progress. list of features i want to add.  -->

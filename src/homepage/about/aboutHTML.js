                Hello! I'm Kunal, a full-stack developer during the day and a physicist by night. I've worked on
                multiple large-scale full-stack projects with different organizations and have dealt with designing
                complex database schemas, designing beautiful UIs, and creating pipelines to host apps. During the
                night, as a physicist, I've worked on trapped ion implementations of quantum computing systems at the
                Institute of Quantum Computing.
